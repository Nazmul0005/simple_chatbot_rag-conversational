And  they  will  serve  as  motivation  to  seek  that  reward  on  the  days  you  don’t  really  feel  like  doing  
it.
 
6.  Track  your  habits  in  a  visual  format  
I  used  to  use  elaborate  habit  tracking  mechanisms  on  paper,  and  using  complex  apps  with  
features
 
like
 
reminder,
 
streak
 
and
 
what
 
not.
 
In  2019-20,  I  scrapped  everything  for  a  while  and  didn't  track  habits  at  all.  
What  I  observed  was,  a  habit  tracker  is  only  required  for  new  habits  that  you  are  still  trying  to  
inculcate
 
and
 
make
 
it
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
your
 
subconscious
 
routines.
 
So  I  still  needed  a  habit  tracker,  but  I  was  tired  of  complex  systems.

1.  Wake  up  at  7am  (because  I  already  am  doing  that,  no  extra  effort)  2.  Exercise  for  15  minutes.  Only  1  activity  -  jog.  3.  Come  back,  bathe  and  get  to  work.  
My  week  went  really  well,  and  I  didn’t  miss  exercise  a  single  day.  Neither  did  it  feel  like  a  task  on  
any
 
given
 
day.
 
And
 
it’s
 
even
 
making
 
me
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
doing
 
it
 
again.
 
So  much  so  that  I  finished  writing  this  post,  went  for  a  jog,  and  came  back  to  finish  editing  it.  
(Before  the  edit,  the  above  sentence  read  as:  So  much  so  that  after  I  finish  writing  this  post,  I'll  
go
 
for
 
my
 
jog.)
 
How  to  make  new  habits  stick

[Resource 3 - resources - habit.pdf - Relevance: 0.7099999785423279]
You’ve  started  a  new  habit,  and  you’ve  performed  it  for  a  few  days  or  weeks  without  any  
hiccups.
 
Congratulations!  The  battle  is  not  over  though.  
You  want  to  continue  performing  this  habit,  improve  over  time,  and  ensure  you  don’t  fall  off  the  
wagon
 
so
 
that
 
a
 
year
 
from
 
now,
 
you
 
don’t
 
have
 
to
 
repeat
 
the
 
whole
 
thing.
 
Here’s  how  you  can  make  it  easier  to  stick  to  habits  in  the  long  term.  
1.  Pick  one  habit  at  a  time  
Until  the  habit  you  are  currently  working  on  isn’t  completely  internalised,  don’t  start  something  
new.
 
You’ll
 
jeopardise
 
the
 
old
 
and
 
the
 
new
 
habit.
 
Sankalp  reminds  me  from  time  to  time  that  he  exercised  consistently  for  15  minutes  a  day,  for  
365
 
days
 
before
 
he
 
started
 
increasing
 
the
 
load.
 
Now
 
he's
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
30-45
 
minutes
 
a
 
day
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
ease
 
as
 
he
 
once
 
did
 
only
 
15
 
minutes.
